What is this?
===

My personal vim scripts and settings. Nothing too mind-blowing, but I 
find it useful having it online and maybe someone will learn something 
or find out about a vim script they never heard of before. 

This uses [pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332), 
which is probably the greatest thing since sliced bread. 

Under bundle, you'll find custom, which is just some custom stuff I added. 
Nothing too magical, just some indenting rules settings, aliases and other 
jazz that I didn't want mucking up my vimrc.


Usage
===

Clone the repo to ~/.vim and symlink ~/.vim/vimrc to ~/.vimrc and you'll see what I see.
